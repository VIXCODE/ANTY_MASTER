# ANIMALITYCOIN - ANTY

-------
-------

AnimalityCoin is a currency focused on the development of endangered species preservation projects, promoting awareness actions and strategies to combat the main causes of this problem.

One of the main causes of species extinction is the degradation and fragmentation of natural environments, due to the opening of large areas for agriculture and pasture formation, urban expansion, expansion of the road network, pollution, formation of lakes for hydroelectric and surface mining. They are factors that reduce habitats and increase the degree of isolation of the populations, reducing the genetic flow between them, causing loss of genetic variability and reducing the survival capacity of the animals.
